# Blauwdruk

This repo contains the "Blue print" of the datamodel of the [City Archives Amsterdam](https://archief.amsterdam/). 

## blauwdruk-shacl
This folder contains files with [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes to validate its data to [Records in Contexts Ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology). It defines a "SOLL" situation: a situation were the data should evolve into.

## memorix-recordtypes
This folder contains the recordtype definitions SAA uses in Memorix Nexus. It differs from the blauwdruk for two reasons: 
* at the moment, not all constructions in the blauwdruk shacl definitions can be realised in forms in a convenient way
* the current data does not fit into the blauwdruk
